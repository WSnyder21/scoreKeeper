Welcome to ScoreKeeper! 

This simple app lets you keep track of the score between two players while playing Ping Pong, 
Tennis or any other game you might need to keep track of the score. 

This app was created in conjunction with the Web Development Bootcamp 2022 course through Udemy by Colt Steele.
